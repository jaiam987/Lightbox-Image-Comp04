It is then reflected three times by the roof pentaprism, rectifying it for the photographer's eye. During exposure, the mirror assembly swings upward, the aperture narrows (if stopped down, or set smaller than wide open), and a shutter opens, allowing the lens to project light onto the image sensor. A second shutter then covers the sensor, ending the exposure, and the mirror lowers while the shutter resets. The period that the mirror is flipped up is referred to as viewfinder blackout. A fast-acting mirror and shutter is preferred so as not to delay an action photo." >

Providing a solution, Canada-based designer Joshua Sin has developed a device concept that liberates the lives of the visually impaired by allowing access to regular text, i.e. newspapers, textbooks, food labels etc, using the same experience as reading Braille. Hailed as “Panopticon,” the futuristic device uses scanner technology to convert text into refreshable-Braille and audio feedback. The device ensures instant audio and Braille feedback based on the speed of scanned input, motivating users to read and build their confidence. ">

Increased processing power and emerging technologies will enable holistic computing systems to be stored in wearable devices, providing a more immersive personal media experience. In a troubling future, these augmented reality devices would offer a new dimension – a virtual layer that could be used to “re-skin” the troubling outside world. A boundary between the wearer and the world around him, the device would become a sort of visual drug, used to make the world appear a better place – even if just for a moment.">
